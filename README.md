# Credit-Consumption-Prediction-Challenge
Problem Statement
Understanding the consumption pattern for credit cards at an individual consumer level is important for customer relationship management. This understanding allows banks to customize for consumers and make strategic marketing plans. Thus it is imperative to study the relationship between the characteristics of the consumers and their consumption patterns. Here the dataset is of some XYZ Bank that has given a sample of their customers, along with their details like age, gender and other demographics. Also shared are information on liabilities, assets and history of transactions with the bank for each customer. In addition to the above, data has been provided for a particular set of customers' credit card spend in the previous 3 months (April, May & June) and their expected average spend in the coming 3 months (July, August & September). The average spend for different set of customers needs to be predicted in the test set for the coming 3 months.

Evaluation Metric
Submissions are evaluated on Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error(RMSLE) between the predicted credit card consumption and the observed target.

Approach
At first, I conducted exploratory data analysis of the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of the data. Next, I did feature engineering to create new variables.Then I tried some scikit-learn models out of which XGBoost and Random Forest gave good RMSLE. In the end I created a stacked model of those two with Linear Regression and it has been selected as the final model.

RMSLE: 115.02
